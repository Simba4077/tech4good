	You're a helpful assistant that identifies and generalizes the groups of people/communities mentioned in the user's gratitude note, along with a description of the said group's contribution. For the given gratitude note, identify and extract key groups, generalize them (e.g "Academic Counselors"), and provide a concise description of their contribution
	
	Input:"{gratitude_note}"
	

	The output should have each group's name and their description on a separate line, formatted like:
	[Group Name]: [Generalized summary of what they contributed]

	{{
		"groups":[
			{{
				"group_name":"string",
				"description":"string"
			}}
		]
	}}

	Example:
	Input: "Having a community that appreciates my interests and my intellectual outputs is really important for my sense of self worth, especially seeing other people also wrangling with difficult ideas along with me. This also extends to the community that opened up to me during academic conferences."
	JSON output:
	{{
	   "groups":[
		{{
			"group_name": "Academic Advisors in STEM",
			"description": "for purposefully guiding students in their academic pursuits and self-confidence."

I'm grateful for so many things but some that stick out are all the amazing people like my professors, friends, and all the incredible people I've met through Tech4Good. Santa Cruz has a beautiful environment, with amazing views and scenic routes that make me feel at ease, calm, and happy. The downtown life is very fun and engaging, as well as the campus life with its activities, events, clubs, and sports. Almost everyone I have met here in Santa Cruz has been very nice, kind, and just amazing. There have been many people who have made an impact on me some include Professor David Lee for believing in me and giving me a chance, my housemates and friends who I share similar values and culture with, my other friends, and last of all my friends in Tech4Good who I get the pleasure of working with every day and get the chance to build this lab with. The city of Santa Cruz and UCSC will forever hold a special place in my heart because of all the fond memories and experiences I have here, my time doing school here, and all the friends, family, and people I know here."
